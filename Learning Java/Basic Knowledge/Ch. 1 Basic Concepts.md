# Chapter 1: Basic Concepts 

## What is Java? 
Java is a high level, modern programming language designed in the early 1990s by Sun Microsystems, and currently owned by Oracle. Java is **platform independent** and has the catchphrase **Write Once, Run Everywhere.** 

## How to run a simple program in Java? 
The basic steps of running a program in Java is:

  1. The Java compiler reads Java language source (.java) files and translates the source into Java bytecodes, and places the bytecodes into class (.class) files. (command in cmd: `javac filename.java)
  2. The class files can then be executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). (command in cmd `java filename.class`)
