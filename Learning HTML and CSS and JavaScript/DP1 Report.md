# Team "Mapping the World"

## Design Experience

### Experience Goal

**Redesign** how people explore a new area **indoors** that they’ve never been before

## LOGISTICS on the Observations & Interviews
### Who were the participants? 
**Participants** were constituted of three people who had never visited a certain building in KAIST 
### How did we choose these participants? 
We each asked friends who met the recruitment criteria (i.e. unfamiliarity with a specific building at KAIST)
### What task did we give to these participants? 
We asked the participants to find a certain number of rooms and amenities as quickly as possible. 
### What did we observe in the tasks?
We tried to observe:
1. **How** the participants reacted when encountered with a difficult task. 
2. **What** actions did the participants took in general.
### What were the Interview Questions?
Interview questions were same for all participants / interviewees 
1.  **How** did you find the destination? & **Tell me** your thought process to find each goal.
2. **Tell me** about the last experience you got lost in a KAIST building. & **Where** was it and why were you lost?
3.  **What** do you want to know *before entering a new building*? Why?
4.  **What** do you not like about *physical maps* (i.e. paper maps, floor plans etc.) and why?
5. **What** features would you have in your *ideal electronic indoor map?* Why?

## Participant Observations & Interviews
### Participant 1 (Interviewed by: Andrew Lee)
* **Background**: Male, Korean (후기), Mechanical Engineering Major, 4^th^ Semester 
* **Tasks:**
	1. Find an elevator 
	2. Find any empty meeting room
	3. Find a flight of stair
	4. Find a vending machine
	5. Find Professor Alice Oh’s office
### Participant 2 (Interviewed by: Azamat Smagulov)
* **Background**: Female, International (From Kazakhstan), Freshmen, 2^nd^ Semester
### Participant 3 (Extreme User; Interviewed by: Gu Hong (Kevin) Min)
* **Background**: 
	* Male, Korean (전기), Mechanical Engineering Major, 3^rd^ Semester
* **Extreme User Quality**: 
	* Has a **time-critical** task of finding the bathroom
* **Extreme User Story**: 
   1.  As a ME major, Participant #3 normally never have to visit E3-1 building.
    2.  However, one day, while he was strolling down the street, he suddenly had the urge to go to the bathroom but the only building he could find was E3-1   
    3.   As it was a weekend, there were no one in the E3-1 building.
    4.  So he had to resort in primitive methods to find the location to the bathroom using maps.

	 1. Find the bathroom
	 2. Find Room 2443
	 3. Find Main Lecture Hall 1

## Studio Reflection

### Studio Feedback
1. (Positive Feedback) **I like** that you **designed** **many different tasks** to discover diverse difficulties the target users might have. It is also great that you tried to get users’ opinion on ‘ideal’ indoor map.
2. (Constructive Feedback #1) **I wish** you had discussed about the occasion the interviewed users looked for indoor map **instead** of using their intuition. What made them **give up** using their **intuition solely**, and what do they want at that specific points?
3. (Constructive Feedback #2) Needs and Insights are very similar to each other. Note that two have different functionality in your design process.
### Studio Reflection & Plans to Address Feedback 
1. The positive feedback was very constructive for our Design Project as it **confirmed that we were in the right track** for our observation & interview questions.
