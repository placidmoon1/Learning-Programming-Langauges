## Design Experience

### Experience Goal

* **Redesign** how people explore a new area **indoors** that they’ve never been before

### Example Usages
- Going to a specific room in a building for a meeting with a client
- Finding a seminar room/lab in a large academic facility
- Searching for a certain person/professor’s office
- Going to a mall to find a certain restaurant ...

## LOGISTICS on the Observations and Interviews
### Who were the participants? 
* **Participants** were constituted of three people who had never visited the E3 building (specifically, the E3-1 & E3-2 building) in KAIST 
### How did we choose these participants? 
* Us three each asked one acquaintance who met the recruitment criteria (i.e. unfamiliarity with KAIST's E3 building)
### What task did we give to these participants? 
* We asked the participants to find a certain number of rooms and amenities in a building that they've never visited before as quickly as possible. 
### What did we observe in the tasks?
We tried to observe:
1. **How** the participants reacted when encountered with a difficult task. 
2. **What** actions did the participants took in general.
### What were the Interview Questions?
Interview questions were same for all participants / interviewees:
1.  **How** did you find the destination? & **Tell me** your thought process to find each goal.
2. **Tell me** about the last experience you got lost in a KAIST building. & **Where** was it and why were you lost?
3.  **What** do you want to know *before entering a new building*? Why?
4.  **What** do you not like about *physical maps* (i.e. paper maps, floor plans etc.) and why?
5. **What** features would you have in your *ideal electronic indoor map?* Why?

## Participant Observations and Interviews
### Participant 1 (Interviewed by: Andrew Lee)
* **Background**: 
	* Male, Korean (후기), Mechanical Engineering Major, 4^th^ Semester 
* **Tasks:**
	1. Find an elevator 
	2. Find any empty meeting room
	3. Find a flight of stair
	4. Find a vending machine
	5. Find Professor Alice Oh’s office
* **Interesting Moments:**
	- Method of search was “exhaustive”; search everywhere in 1st floor, go up, repeat. 
	- Relies on intuition to find rooms in new building
	- *“Hard to use intuition \[above\] in this experiment since I was in the middle of nowhere"*

### Participant 2 (Interviewed by: Azamat Smagulov)
* **Background**: 
	* Female, International (From Kazakhstan), Freshmen, 2^nd^ Semester
* **Tasks:**
	1. Start from the main entrance to E3-1 and find meeting room with tv on the second floor 
	2. Find Administration Team of School of Computing
	3. Find bathroom for women
	4. Find water dispenser
	5. Find Artificial Intelligence and Media Lab (room #4435)
* **Interesting Moments:**
	- Rooms in E3-1 are easy to find if you know the room number. For example, room #1433, it is on the first floor, and there are labels on the wall, that guide the visitor in the correct direction.
	- ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NlLUMR0KXCGLIyazie2W7dTWwoI09pJumHbpn7mbtpN5E_iN7HrP-4GP_9QpPgt-HyQ2ZjEz-XHPU1FvsfywB7jbduHt3Z9ZFElKlX_X7r0TtUjjZPXsJjem226gkAt5EBYk18b7BpQ)
	- Shared her story of getting lost at E3-2 building. Had a lecture at E3-2, 1220. Could not find the room on the first and second floors. Then, asked korean student for help, who carried her to the administration team and they showed her the room. The search took 22 minutes in total including walk from E-9 to the E3-2, as a result was late to the lecture.
### Participant 3 (Extreme User; Interviewed by: Gu Hong (Kevin) Min)
* **Background**: 
	* Male, Korean (전기), Mechanical Engineering Major, 3^rd^ Semester
* **Extreme User Quality**: 
	* Has a **time-critical** task of finding the bathroom
* **Extreme User Story**: 
   1.  As a ME major, Participant #3 normally never have to visit E3-1 building.
    2.  However, one day, while he was strolling down the street, he suddenly had the urge to go to the bathroom but the only building he could find was E3-1   
    3.   As it was a weekend, there were no one in the E3-1 building.
    4.  So he had to resort in primitive methods to find the location to the bathroom using maps.
 * **Tasks**: 
	 1. Find the bathroom
	 2. Find Room 2443
	 3. Find Main Lecture Hall 1
	 4. Batting Practicing Range
* **Interesting Moments:**
	- Used a physical map to locate his desired destination
	- Asked questions to other people to locate his desired location after looking for several minutes

## Needs
1. **Find** the desired destination 
2. **Locate** a map around them to help find their destination
3. **Learn** the surroundings quickly so that one can compare their surroundings with the map
4. **Explore** opportunities within that building

## Insights
1. Provided floor plans has low usability

2. Sometimes had to use external help to find place
3. Some features of a building aren’t well known to a new person in a building
4. Users used “intuition” to find their destination
## Studio Reflection

### Studio Feedback
1. (Positive Feedback) **I like** that you **designed** **many different tasks** to discover diverse difficulties the target users might have. It is also great that you tried to get users’ opinion on ‘ideal’ indoor map.
2. (Constructive Feedback #1) **I wish** you had discussed about the occasion the interviewed users looked for indoor map **instead** of using their intuition. What made them **give up** using their **intuition solely**, and what do they want at that specific points?
3. (Constructive Feedback #2) Needs and Insights are very similar to each other. Note that two have different functionality in your design process.
### Studio Reflection & Plans to Address Feedback 
1. The positive feedback was very constructive for our Design Project as it **confirmed that we were in the right track** for our observation & interview questions.
